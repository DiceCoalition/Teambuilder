# Cypress Testing

Cypress can be used to test the functionality of the app.  Yarn can be used to install the NPM modules for Cypress:

```
yarn install
```

The index.html file can be loaded in a local web server (TODO: replace this with PHP instructions):

```
npm run server
```

Once the app is running, tests can be run against it:

```
npm run cypress:open
```
